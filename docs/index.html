            <h2>👋 About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi there! I’m Cathrine, a freshly graduated cyber security enthusiast with a knack for solving puzzles—both digital and real-world. 
                When I’m not diving deep into cyber security research or refining benchmarks for AI models, you’ll likely find me exploring escape rooms or enjoying live music. 
                I also dabble in 35mm photography—check out my shots on <a href="https://instagram.com/rawshrimps" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.

                I graduated with a <strong>Bachelor of Applied Science in Data and Cyber Security</strong> from the University of Doha for Science and Technology in June 2024. 
                My studies focused on network security, applied cryptography, digital forensics, and ethical hacking. 
                I loved every second of learning how to keep systems secure and occasionally testing their limits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before that, I earned a <strong>Diploma in Information Systems - Software</strong> from the College of the North Atlantic - Qatar (2019–2021), 
                where I honed my skills in software development and system design.
