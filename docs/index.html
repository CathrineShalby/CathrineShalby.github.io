                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m Cathrine Shalby, a Cyber Security Research Assistant with a passion for understanding how systems work and, occasionally, how they fail. 
                    My work involves diving into vulnerabilities, building secure solutions, and figuring out the pieces that make systems tick. 
                    Outside of work, I enjoy exploring creative outlets like 35m                  m photography and occasionally testing my problem-solving skills on intricate puzzles.

                <p>
                    I’m naturally drawn to figuring out how things work—whether it’s systems, puzzles, or vintage cameras. 
                    When I’m not exploring tech, you’ll find me capturing moments with my 35mm film camera or unwinding at a live music event. 
                    My creative experiments often end up on <a href="https://instagram.com/rawshrimps" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.
